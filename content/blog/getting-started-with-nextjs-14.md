# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 introduces powerful new features that make building modern web applications easier and more efficient. In this article, we'll explore the key concepts and best practices.

## App Router

The App Router is the new default routing system in Next.js 13+. It provides a more intuitive file-based routing system with support for layouts, loading states, and error boundaries.

## Server Components

Server Components allow you to build faster applications by moving data fetching and rendering to the server. This reduces the amount of JavaScript sent to the client and improves performance.

## Best Practices

- Use Server Components by default
- Leverage the App Router for better organization
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Optimize images with next/image
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
